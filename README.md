# python-api-challenge

Introduction: 

This assignment utilizes Pandas, MatPlotLib, and Jupyter Notebook to extract data from two different APIs, openweathermap and Google Places. This data is then visualized through scatter plots, linear regressions, and heatmaps.



Observations/Problems:

This assignment was overall quite challenging and took some trial and error to troubleshoot. The fixed code for the markers in VacationPy was particularly problematic at first and required some testing to see how to utilize it.
